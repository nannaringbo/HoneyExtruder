# Automated Honey Extrusion Machine
The automated honey extrusion machine, was designed and developed for the exam project in the course "How to make (almost) anything" at the IT University of copenhagen.

**Project Description**
The development of the Automated Honey Extrusion Machine is driven by a fundamental need among beekeeper hobbyists – the inherent imprecision of manual honey dispensing methods. While larger manufacturers benefit from industrial solutions, hobbyists grapple with inconvenient manual processes. Our motivation is clear: to present a straightforward solution tailored for beekeeper hobbyists, enabling them to extract honey precisely and effortlessly. When we talk about "precision," we refer to adherence to the official regulations that allow a maximum weight deviation of ± 2\% g for honey-filled containers\cite{Danmarks biavlerforening}, typically containing 225g or 450g. Our project wants to streamline the extraction process but also ensure compliance with these standards, addressing the practical challenges faced by beekeeper hobbyists. With our project we envision that automated honey extrusion becomes more accessible to hobbyists, serving both the motivation to simplify the process and the necessity to meet regulatory requirements.
